# abacus

A new octopress theme created by taking the best out of everything.

Simple, good readability, less clustered and beautiful.

Check the live demo here: [http://bhrigu.me](http://bhrigu.me)


### Quick install


```
  % cd octopress
  % git clone https://github.com/dixonmartinez/abacus .themes/abacus
  % rake install['abacus']
  % rake generate
```

### Setting up the theme
After you have followed the above steps, do the following to finish setting up the theme:

1. Set up your site title, subtitle and author in your `_config.yml` file (if you haven't already).

2. Open file `source/_includes/custom/navigation_links.html` and edit the given list items. These will be in your navigation bar and home page. Edit/add/remove the anchor tags and their links.

3. In the folder `source/images`, replace the given `avatar.jpg` image file with your own pic. This pic will be displayed in the author info section of your blog posts.

4. Run `rake generate` once more.



`Note:` If your date format is not appearing properly on your site (it can happen that it shows "ordinal" written instead of date), then open your `_config.yml` file and edit the `date_format` parameter and change its value to:<br>
`date_format: "%a %e %b %Y, %l:%M %p" `


### More customizations

#### Changing the banner 
The banner image is present here: `source/images/banner.jpg`. To change your banner, replace this pic with another one & run `rake generate`.
